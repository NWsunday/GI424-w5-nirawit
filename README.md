# Game Optimization Assignment

## Instructions

1. **Create a new branch named `develop`**  
   Make sure to do all your optimization work in this branch.

2. **Game Functionality**  
   - The game must remain fully functional.  
   - Shadows must be correct and visually consistent. If shadows are broken or any assets missing, your work will **not** be graded.
3. **Optimization Goal**  
   - Your main goal is to reduce the number of **batches and draw calls**.  
   - The lower your batch/draw call count goes, the higher your score.

## Submission

- Push your optimized code to the `develop` branch.  
- Keep the `master` branch unchanged.
